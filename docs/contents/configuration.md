# Configuration

!!! note
    ngless' results do not change because of configuration or command line
    options. **The ngless script always has complete information on what is
    computed**. What configuration options change are details of _how_ the
    results are computed such as where to store intermediate files and how many
    CPU cores to use.

Ngless gets its configuration options from the following sources:

1. Defaults/auto-configuration
2. A global configuration file
3. A user configuration file (typically `$HOME/.config/ngless.conf`)
4. A configuration file present in the current directory`
5. A configuration file specified on the command line
6. Command line options

In case an option is specified more than once, the order above determines
priority: later options take precedence.

## Options

`jobs`: number of CPUs to use.

`temporary-directory`: where to keep temporary files. By default, this is the
system defined temporary directory (either `/tmp` or the value of the
`$TEMPDIR` environment variable on Unix).

`color`: whether to use color output. Defaults to `auto` (i.e., print color if
the output is a terminal), `no` (never use color), `force` (use color even if
writing to a file or pipe), `yes` (synonym of `force`).

`print-header`: whether to print ngless banner (version info...).

`user-directory`: user writable directory to cache downloads (default is system
dependent, on Linux, typically `$HOME/.local/share/ngless/`.

`user-data-directory`: user writable directory to cache data (default is a
`data` directory inside the `user-directory` [see above]).

`global-data-directory`: global data directory.

## Debug options

`keep-temporary-files`: whether to keep temporary files after the end of the programme.

`trace` (only command line): print a lot of internal information.
